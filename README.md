Stock Analysis Machine Learning 

Collected historical stock data of POWERGRID.NS from Yahoo Finance using yfinance and processed it using Pandas.

Visualized stock trends over time with Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze price movement and patterns.

Scaled the closing price data using MinMaxScaler to prepare it for deep learning models.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (70:30 ratio) for time series modeling.

Designed and trained an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for stock price prediction.

Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualized predicted vs. actual stock prices.

Gained insights into short-term trends to simulate real-world trading scenarios and investment strategy development.
